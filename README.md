# Hi, I'm Jerome Joseph 👋
Software Engineering Student | Junior Full-Stack Engineer | Builder of Production-Ready Systems

I’m a Software Engineering student at AUT (graduating 2026) focused on building production-grade web applications with clean architecture, predictable behavior, and long-term maintainability.

I enjoy working on problems where correctness, security, and user experience matter - especially in systems that ship to real users. I’m actively preparing for junior software engineering roles where I can contribute meaningful code, learn from experienced engineers, and grow quickly.

## What I Care About
- Writing maintainable backend and full-stack code

- Designing systems that behave correctly under edge cases

- Shipping features safely using modern tooling and CI/CD

- Clear documentation and predictable data flows
